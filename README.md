## 📈 Predictive Modeling (Regression)

- Implemented **linear and polynomial regression models** for predictive analysis on a real-world dataset.  
- Ensured proper **train–test separation** to prevent data leakage.  
- Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**.  
- Analyzed the effect of **model complexity** and studied **bias–variance trade-offs** to identify the best-performing model.
